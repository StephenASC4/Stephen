    I wanna be the very best,
    Like no one ever was.
    To catch them all is my real test,
    To train them is my cause,

    I will travel across the land,
    Searching far and wide.
    Teach Pokemon to understand
    The power that's inside!
    
    Pokemon, (gotta catch them all) its you and me
    I know its my destiny
    Pokemon, oh, you're my best friend
    In a world we must defend
     
    Pokemon, (gotta catch them all) a heart so true
    Our courage will pull us through
    You teach me and I'll teach you
    (Po-ke-mon) Gotta catch 'em all

    Yeah!
    
    Every challenge along the way
    With courage I will face
    I will battle every day
    To claim my rightful place,
    
    Come with me, the time is right
    There's no better team
    Arm in arm we'll win the fight
    It's always been our dream!
    
    Pokemon!
    
    (Gotta catch 'em all)  

    It's you and me
    I know it's my destiny
    
    Pokemon!
    
    Oh, you're my best friend,
    In a world we must defend.
    
    Pokemon!
    
    A heart so true.
    Our courage will pull us through.
    You teach me and I'll teach you,   
    
    Pokemon!
    Gotta catch 'em all
    Gotta catch 'em all
    Gotta catch 'em all
    Gotta catch 'em all
    Gotta catch 'em all



Yeah!

Pokemon!

It's you and me
I know it's my destiny!

Pokemon!

Oh, you're my best friend!
In a world we must defend.

Pokemon!

A heart so true.
Our courage will pull us through.
You teach me and I'll teach you,

POKEMON!

Gotta catch them all!
Gotta catch them all!

Pokemon!
